# My Profile: Technical Resume & Blog for Databases and Graph Technologies

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a Data Engineer and Graph Architect passionate about designing scalable database solutions and exploring the power of graph technologies. With deep knowledge of SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Gremlin (Apache TinkerPop), I combine traditional RDBMS with modern graph data models to solve complex problems. I'm also a strong advocate of open-source and automation using Docker, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD pipelines.

## 📝 My Blog (Gatsby + GitHub Pages)
### Purpose
To share, teach, and document real-world experiences in Data Engineering, Graph Systems, Simulation, and Automation with bilingual support (English/Arabic).

### Concept Pages Strategy
Instead of filtering by date, isolate your blog content by concept-specific pages:
- `src/pages/knowledge-graph.js`
- `src/pages/rules-engine.js`
- `src/pages/data-cleansing.js`
- `src/pages/data-mining.js`
- `src/pages/datawarehouse.js`
- `src/pages/simulations.js`
- `src/pages/particles.js`

Each page uses GraphQL to filter posts with a matching frontmatter field (e.g., `concept: simulations`, `concept: particles`). This enhances topic navigation, improves SEO, and offers readers focused learning paths.

The **Simulations** page will cover:
- WebGL for high-performance browser visualizations
- OpenGL for C++/Python-based 3D rendering
- Kippler.jl (Julia) for orbital and physical simulations
- Use cases in Data Science, Graph Analysis, and Geographic Mapping

The **Particles** page will showcase:
- Procedural animation using **Houdini**
- Particle systems for natural simulations like **moving sea**, **sandstorm**, **smoke**, and **dust clouds**
- Rendering strategies and performance tips
- Integration with storytelling projects and cinematic graphs
